            <p>A BIKE (also called a motor bicycle, motorbike, motorcycle, or cycle) is a single-track, two-wheeled motor vehicle. Motorcycles vary considerably depending on the task for which they are designed, such as long distance travel, navigating congested urban traffic, cruising, sport and racing, or off-road conditions. BIKES are the most affordable form of motorised transport in many parts of the world, and for most of the worldâ€™s population, they are also the most common type of motor vehicle. There are around 200 million BIKES (including mopeds, motor scooters and other powered two- and three-wheelers) in use worldwide, or about 33 motorcycles per 1000 people. An IMC plan is a blueprint of the complete marketing communications program for a brand. It is a formal document that evaluates the background of the brand and presents a set of guidelines and an action program for the advertising and promotions campaign. The planning model is shown in Figure 1-4 in the text. The IMC plan for this project will be for the market specified by your instructor and will cover one calendar year.</p>
